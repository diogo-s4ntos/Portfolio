                <h3>Setúbal Scout and Fencing Athlete: Nurturing Community Spirit and Teamwork</h3>
                <p>In my role as a Setúbal Scout, I actively participated in volunteer work, primarily focusing on organizing food drives for the less fortunate. Beyond this, my commitment to community service extends to various initiatives, including environmental clean-ups. This multifaceted engagement broadened my understanding of community needs, fostering adaptability and teamwork skills.
                Additionally, my background as a former competitive fencer at GCP instilled in me a strong team spirit and discipline, contributing to effective collaboration in both volunteer activities and other aspects of my life.</p>
